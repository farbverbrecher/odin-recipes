  <h1>Roulades Reciped</h1>
  <p>Roulades are savory dishes consisting of thinly sliced meat or fish rolled around a flavorful filling, such as cheese, vegetables, or herbs. These rolls are then seared or baked until cooked through, resulting in a deliciously tender and flavorful main course.</p>
 <br> 
  <p>Indegrents:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Thinly sliced meat or fish (such as beef, chicken, pork, or salmon)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>Filling ingredients (e.g., cheese, vegetables, herbs, or spreads)</li>
    <li>Olive oil or butter, for cooking</li>
    <li>Toothpicks or kitchen twine (optional)</li>
  </ul>
<br>
<p> Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare the Meat or Fish: Lay out the thinly sliced meat or fish on a clean work surface. If necessary, pound the slices to an even thickness using a meat mallet to ensure they cook evenly.</p></li>
  <li>Season the Meat or Fish: Season both sides of the meat or fish slices with salt and pepper to taste.</p></li>
  <li>Add Filling: Spread a thin layer of your chosen filling ingredients evenly over each slice of meat or fish. This could be cheese, vegetables, herbs, or spreads, depending on your preference.</p></li>
  <li>Roll Up: Starting from one end, tightly roll up each slice of meat or fish around the filling ingredients. If needed, secure the rolls with toothpicks or kitchen twine to hold them together.</li>
  <li>Cook Roulades: Heat some olive oil or butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place the roulades seam side down in the skillet and cook until browned on all sides, turning occasionally, about 2-3 minutes per side.</p></li>
  <li>Finish Cooking: Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking the roulades until they are cooked through. The exact cooking time will depend on the thickness of the meat or fish slices and the filling ingredients used. Use a meat thermometer to ensure they reach the appropriate internal temperature.</li>
  <li>Serve: Once cooked, remove the roulades from the skillet and transfer them to a serving plate. Allow them to rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute. Serve the roulades hot with your favorite side dishes or sauces.</p></li>
