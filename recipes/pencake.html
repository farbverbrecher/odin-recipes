  <h1>Pencake Reciped</h1>
  <p>Pancakes are a classic breakfast dish made from a batter consisting of flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder. Once the batter is mixed, it's poured onto a hot griddle or frying pan and cooked until golden brown on both sides. Pancakes are often enjoyed with toppings like syrup, butter, fruit, or chocolate chips.</p>

  <p>Indegrents:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Milk (or buttermilk)</li>
    <li>Baking powder (or baking soda)</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Sugar (optional)</li>
    <li>Butter or oil (for cooking)/li>
    <li>Vanilla extract (optional, for flavoring)</li>
  </ul>
<br>
<p> Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar (optional), 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt.s</p></li>
  <li>Prepare Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, beat 2 large eggs lightly. Then add 1 1/4 cups of milk (or buttermilk) and 2 tablespoons of melted butter (or oil). You can also add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract for extra flavor if desired.</p></li>
  <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a spatula or whisk to gently mix everything together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps in the batter are okay.</p></li>
  <li>Preheat Cooking Surface: Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to the skillet and spread it evenly to coat the surface.</li>
  <li>Cook Pancakes: Once the skillet is hot, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges start to look set, about 2-3 minutes.</p></li>
  <li>Flip and Cook: Use a spatula to carefully flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
  <li>Serve: Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and repeat the process with the remaining batter. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, butter, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</p></li>
